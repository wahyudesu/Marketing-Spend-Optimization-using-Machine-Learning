        " In this approach, we typically look at budget proportion allocation based on predefined rules. Rule-based systems are easy to implement and interpret, but they may not be very accurate or adaptive. It makes sense to use them when you have a specific business mandate (example - ease of managing ads or segment of users you want to target).\n",

        "\n",
        "### **2. Statistical techniques:**\n",
        " Statistical techniques such as correlation, probability are very helpful to find the righ budget mix for each marketing channel. In this approach, we use historical data to come up with priors and correlations to do budget allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Linear optimizatiom:**\n",
        "In this approach, we define the objective function(e.g. increase conversion, reduce total cost) and the constraints(e.g. we should not spend more than 1000$ on Instagram) to come up with a linear equation. The linear equation is usually solved using a solver such as Gurobi, Pulp, etc. for the right solution which gives the amount of money company needs to spend on each channel.\n",

Data exploration is important because it helps to provide a solid foundation for subsequent data analysis tasks, hypothesis testing and data visualization.\n",

Knowing the dimensions of the dataset is important to understand the amount of data available for analysis and to determine the feasibility of different methods of analysis.\n",

        "* Describe: The describe function provides a summary of the numerical columns in the dataset. It includes the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values, as well as the quartiles. It helps to understand the distribution of the data, the presence of any outliers, and potential issues that can affect the model's accuracy.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* Dropna: The dropna function is used to remove rows or columns with missing data. It is used to remove any observations or variables with missing data, which can lead to biased results in the regression analysis. The dropna function is used after identifying the missing data with the isnull function.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Columns: The .columns method is a built-in function that is used to display the column names of a pandas DataFrame or Series. It returns an array-like object that contains the names of the columns in the order in which they appear in the original DataFrame or Series. It can be used to obtain a quick overview of the variables in a dataset and their names."

        "For example, consider a scenario where the preprocessing step involves imputing missing values in the dataset. If the missing values are imputed using the mean or median values of the entire dataset, including the test and prediction data, then the imputed values in the training data may be influenced by the values in the test and prediction data. This can lead to data leakage, as the model may learn to recognize patterns in the test and prediction data during the training process, leading to overfitting and poor generalization performance.\n",

        "To avoid data leakage, it's important to perform the data preprocessing steps on the training data only, and then apply the same preprocessing steps to the test and prediction data separately. This ensures that the test and prediction data remain unseen by the model during the training process, and helps to prevent overfitting and improve the accuracy of the model.\n",

This process of splitting is then repeated in a top-down, recursive manner until all, or the majority of records have been classified under specific class labels. Whether or not all data points are classified as homogenous sets is largely dependent on the complexity of the decision tree. Smaller trees are more easily able to attain pure leaf nodes—i.e. data points in a single class.\n",

        "However, as a tree grows in size, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain this purity, and it usually results in too little data falling within a given subtree. When this occurs, it is known as data fragmentation, and it can often lead to overfitting. As a result, decision trees have preference for small trees, which is consistent with the principle of parsimony in Occam’s Razor; that is, “entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity.” Said differently, decision trees should add complexity only if necessary, as the simplest explanation is often the best. To reduce complexity and prevent overfitting, pruning is usually employed; this is a process, which removes branches that split on features with low importance. The model’s fit can then be evaluated through the process of cross-validation."

In other words, the boosting algorithm tries to learn from the mistakes of the previous models and improve the overall accuracy of the ensemble.\n",

As a result, the new model is more specialized and can improve the accuracy of the ensemble.\n",

Each of these algorithms has its own approach to assigning weights to the data points and building the new models, but they all share the fundamental idea of iteratively improving the accuracy of the ensemble by combining weak models into a strong one.

Boosting involves specifying a weak model, such as regression or decision trees, and then improving it. In Ensemble Learning, the primary difference between Bagging and Boosting is that in bagging, weak learners are trained in simultaneously, but in boosting, they are trained sequentially. This means that each new model iteration increases the weights of the prior model's misclassified data. This redistribution of weights aids the algorithm in determining which parameters it should focus on in order to increase its performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both the Ensemble techniques are used in a different way as well.  Bagging methods, for example, are often used on poor learners who have large variance and low bias such as decision trees because they tend to overfit, whereas boosting methods are employed when there is low variance and high bias. While bagging can help prevent overfitting, boosting methods are more vulnerable to it because of a simple fact they continue to build on weak learners and continue to minimise error. This can lead to overfitting on the training data but specifying a decent number of models to be generated or hyperparameter tuning,  regularization can help in this case, if overfitting encountered.\n"

        "\n",
        "**Recall**: Use the recall score when the cost of false negatives (i.e., missing instances of a class) is high. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, the cost of missing a positive case may be high, so recall would be a more appropriate metric.\n",
        "Recall score (also known as sensitivity) is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. It is given by the following formula:\n",
        "$$ Recall = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "**Precision**: Precision is another important classification evaluation metric, which is defined as the ratio of true positives to the total predicted positives. It measures the accuracy of positive predictions made by the classifier, i.e., the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.\n",
        "The formula for precision is:\n",
        "$$ precision = \\frac{true\\ positive}{true\\ positive + false\\ positive} $$\n",

In such cases, a higher precision indicates that the model is better at identifying true positives and minimizing false positives.\n",

It is calculated as the area under the ROC curve. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. TPR is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives, and FPR is the number of false positives divided by the sum of false positives and true negatives.\n",

        "\n",
        "* ROC AUC score: Use the ROC AUC score when the ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes is important. For example, in a credit scoring problem, the ability to distinguish between good and bad credit risks is crucial.\n",

        "Importance with respect to the business problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "The importance of each evaluation metric varies depending on the business problem. For example, in a spam detection problem, precision may be more important than recall, since false positives (i.e., classifying a non-spam email as spam) may annoy users, while false negatives (i.e., missing a spam email) may not be as harmful. On the other hand, in a disease diagnosis problem, recall may be more important than precision, since missing a positive case (i.e., a false negative) could have serious consequences. Therefore, it is important to choose the evaluation metric that is most relevant to the specific business problem at hand.\n",

        "Precision-Recall (PR) curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC) curve are evaluation metrics commonly used in binary classification problems to assess the performance of a model and determine an appropriate threshold for decision making.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Precision-Recall (PR) curve is a graphical representation of the trade-off between precision and recall for different classification thresholds. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions, while recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances in the data. The PR curve plots precision on the y-axis and recall on the x-axis, with each point on the curve representing a different classification threshold. A higher precision and recall indicate better model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a single scalar value that summarizes the PR curve. It measures the overall performance of the model across all possible classification thresholds. The AUC value ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates better model performance. An AUC of 1 represents a perfect model that achieves maximum precision and recall across all thresholds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Choosing the right threshold depends on the specific requirements of your problem. The PR curve can help you visualize the precision-recall trade-off at different thresholds. If your problem prioritizes precision (minimizing false positives), you may want to choose a threshold that maximizes precision while maintaining a reasonable level of recall. On the other hand, if recall is more important (minimizing false negatives), you would choose a threshold that maximizes recall while still maintaining an acceptable level of precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "The selection of the threshold ultimately depends on the cost or impact of false positives and false negatives in your specific problem domain. By analyzing the PR curve and considering the specific requirements and trade-offs of your problem, you can make an informed decision about the threshold that best balances precision and recall for your particular use case.\n",
